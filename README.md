# AI - Using YOLO for Object Detection and Counting in Images on Google Colab
# Introduction

Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves identifying and locating objects within an image. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that can be leveraged to detect and count objects efficiently. This article will guide you through using YOLO to detect and count objects inside an image using Google Colab.
